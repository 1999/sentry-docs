Transports are used to send events to Sentry. Transports can be customized to some degree to better support highly specific deployments. You can control the transport by passing [transport](/platforms/node/configuration/options/#transport) option to `Sentry.init(options)`.

By default, Sentry Node.JS SDK uses `HTTPTransport` and `HTTPSTransport` transports with `keepAlive` setting turned off.

## Forge transport for UI Kit apps

You can use custom transport for your Forge UI Kit apps: [@atlassian/sentry-transport-forge](https://npmjs.com/package/@atlassian/sentry-transport-forge).

```javascript
import { ForgeRuntimeTransport } from "@atlassian/sentry-transport-forge";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

const DISABLE_INTEGRATIONS = [
  Sentry.Integrations.Http,
  Sentry.Integrations.OnUncaughtException,
  Sentry.Integrations.OnUnhandledRejection,
];

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  // version 6.9.0 enables `autoSessionTracking` by default
  // `autoSessionTracking` uses `process.on('beforeExit')` which is not available in Forge runtime
  transport: ForgeRuntimeTransport,
  autoSessionTracking: false,
  integrations: integrations => {
    return integrations.filter(integration => {
      return DISABLE_INTEGRATIONS.every(DisableIntegrationConstructor => {
        return !(integration instanceof DisableIntegrationConstructor);
      });
    });
  },
  ...restOptions,
});
```

Using default Sentry SDK for Node.JS transport won't work for UI Kit apps: the default transport expects standard Node.JS environment whereas functions in UI Kit are executed in a [special sandbox](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference#javascript-environment) which doesnâ€™t support all Node.JS features. The custom transport uses Forge [Fetch API](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/runtime-reference/fetch-api/) to send errors and events.
