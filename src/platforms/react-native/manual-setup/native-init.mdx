By default, the React Native SDK will initialize the native SDK underneath when the `init` method is called on the JS layer. This currently has the limitation of not capturing native crashes that occur before the `init` method is called on the JS layer. You could also look to initialize the native SDKs yourself to be able to provide custom options above what the React Native SDK currently provides.

To do so, you would set [autoInitializeNativeSdk](/platforms/react-native/configuration/options/#autoInitializeNativeSdk) to `false` in the init options:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  autoInitializeNativeSdk: false,
});
```

This will prevent the React Native SDK from initializing the native SDK automatically.

<Alert level="info" title="Note">

Do not use `autoInitializeNativeSdk` to disable the native layer, instead use [enableNative](/platforms/react-native/configuration/options/#enableNative)

</Alert>

You will then have to initialize the native SDKs yourself following the guides for Android or iOS. You do not need to install any of the native SDKs by yourself as they are already packaged with the React Native SDK.

## Android Configuration

To use auto-init, you would have to add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.auto-init" tools:replace="android:value" android:value="true" />
```

then you can follow [the guide on initializing Android](/platforms/android/#configure).

<Note>

Initializing via the above method uses a Content Provider; because the Javascript engine for React Native is also initialized via a Content Provider we cannot guarantee that Sentry would always initialize before the Javascript engine.

</Note>

If you chose to manually initialize the Android SDK you can [follow the guide](/platforms/android/configuration/manual-init/) without needing to add the tag as `io.sentry.auto-init` is set to `false` by the React Native SDK.

## iOS Configuration

You can just follow the [configuration guide for iOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/#configure) to initialize the Sentry Cocoa SDK.
